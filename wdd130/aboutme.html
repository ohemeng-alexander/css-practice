        <p>Hello lovely people,my name is Alexander Ohemeng Mintah, I’m from Ghana and very excited to begin a new semester with all of you. I’m a cool-headed person who likes to see things from other people’s perspective. This enables me to give them the benefit of any doubt and not judge anyone too easily. I try to keep a positive posture and always calm in whatever situation I find myself stuck in. This a trait I find really cool about my personality and I think it has saved me from many troubles.To be honest I’m taking this course because it builds up to my final degree at BYU-Idaho and it is a necessary course for my online studies. But I believe that it will help me know more about my savior Jesus Christ and give me sort of a divine direction while pursuing my degree.</p>
